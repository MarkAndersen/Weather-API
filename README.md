# Weather-API

## Description
The purpose of this exercise was to creat a weather dashboard app. The weather dashboard was to utilize third party web api's and server side API's, specifically Openweather Opencall and geocoding, boostrap.css and moment.js.
The user is presented with a page where they have the option of typing in the zip code or selecting a city (among the 8 most populous in the US) and receiving current conditions, as well as a 5 day forecast below.

# Final Thoughts

I thoroughly enjoyed this exercised even if I was not able to get the weather icons or uv color to work correctly. Pulling information on an api call is very interesting to me and was an enjoyable practice to utilize.
